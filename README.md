# CodeKiwi Site (Marketing + Teacher Portal)

> The official website and teacher dashboard for [CodeKiwi](https://codekiwi.tech) — a platform for teaching live, interactive coding lessons.

## Overview
This site introduces CodeKiwi to educators and provides access to teacher tools.  
It includes:
- Public marketing and product pages  
- Teacher login and onboarding portal  
- Pricing, documentation, and support information  

Built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **TailwindCSS**, it connects directly to the backend for session creation and management.

## Role in the CodeKiwi Ecosystem
This is the public and teacher-facing layer of the platform — where sessions begin, classes launch, and teachers connect their Google Slides.
